Dev Env setting with OS X 10.15.6

Q1: for some reason Apple removed /usr/local/include from system at the beginning about version 10.14.
when we excuted 'make' will occur apue.h missing error

A1: 
```shell
# by install gcc to remake dir 
$ brew install gcc
  ... 

# then create a soft link from /include/aupe.h
$ ln -s /Users/king/OpenSource/unix/apue.3e/include/apue.h /usr/local/include/apue.h
```
